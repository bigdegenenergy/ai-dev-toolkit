# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

> Generated by Gemini

```toml
[review]
summary = "The PR includes several fixes for the Claude Code agent workflow, but also contains temporary artifacts and debugging code that must be cleaned up before merging. Specifically, the `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file and verbose debug logging in the workflow should be removed."
decision = "REQUEST_CHANGES"

severity = "critical"
file = "REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md"
line = 1
title = "Remove temporary review instructions file"
description = "The `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file appears to be a generated artifact for the agent's consumption. Committing this to the repository is discouraged as it pollutes the history. Please remove it from the PR."
suggestion = "git rm REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md"

title = "Remove debug logging and consolidate SDK installation"
description = "The workflow currently includes debugging steps (e.g., listing files) and installs the SDK in multiple locations (temp dir and script dir). This increases build time and complexity. Please remove the debug steps and ensure a single, clean installation strategy."
suggestion = "Remove debug steps and use a single `npm install` location with appropriate `NODE_PATH`."

title = "Verify 'git reset' target branch"
description = "The workflow was updated to use `git reset --hard` instead of `git pull --rebase`. Ensure that the reset target is the PR's source branch (e.g., `origin/${{ github.head_ref }}`) rather than `origin/main`. Resetting to `main` while on a PR branch will effectively discard the PR's changes."
suggestion = "Confirm the git reset target matches the PR branch."

title = "Verify named exports for ESM import"
description = "The script uses `const { Claude } = await import(...)`. Ensure that the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package provides a named export `Claude`. If it relies on a default export, this destructuring might fail."
suggestion = "Validate the import syntax against the package exports."
