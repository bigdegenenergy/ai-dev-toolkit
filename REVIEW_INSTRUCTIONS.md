description = "Logging `process.env` to the console will dump all environment variables, including sensitive secrets (API keys, GITHUB_TOKEN, etc.), into the public build logs. This allows anyone with view access to the logs to compromise the repository and infrastructure."
suggestion = "Remove the `console.log` statement dumping `process.env`. If specific non-sensitive variables are needed for debugging, log them explicitly by name."
