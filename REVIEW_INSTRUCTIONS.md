      "title": "Potential Log Confusion (Force vs Update)",
      "description": "By allowing `FORCE_MODE` to fall through the detection block, the script might execute logic intended for updates (e.g., logging 'Update mode'). This can be confusing for users performing a forced reinstall.",
      "suggestion": "Verify that the subsequent logic differentiates between `FORCE_MODE` and `UPDATE_MODE` so the user receives accurate feedback (e.g., 'Force installing...' vs 'Updating...')."
