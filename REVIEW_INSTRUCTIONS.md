# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

> Generated by Gemini

```toml
[review]
summary = "The changes to the SDK integration logic significantly improve reliability and security by isolating the dependency installation and fixing module resolution. However, the PR mistakenly includes a generated artifact (`REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) that must be removed before merging. I also have a correctness concern regarding the order of operations in the git synchronization logic."

description = "The file `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` is included in the PR diff. As noted in the file's own content ('This file should be ephemeral and not committed'), this is a runtime artifact intended for agent context and should not be committed to source control."

title = "Risk of data loss with `git reset --hard`"
description = "Replacing `git pull --rebase` with `git reset --hard` ensures a clean state relative to the remote, but it destroys all local uncommitted changes. If the review instructions are generated *before* this command runs (e.g., in a previous step or earlier in the script), they will be deleted before they can be committed."
suggestion = "Ensure that the content generation for `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` occurs *after* the `git reset --hard` command in the workflow script."

title = "Hardcoded fallback path assumption"
description = "The script defaults `SDK_PATH` to `/tmp/claude-sdk`. While valid for the CI environment, this might be confusing for local debugging or if the CI environment changes. Consider verifying the path exists before requiring it to provide a helpful error message."
suggestion = "Add a check: `if (!require('fs').existsSync(sdkPath)) { console.error('SDK not found at ' + sdkPath); process.exit(1); }` before the require call."
