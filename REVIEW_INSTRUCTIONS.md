# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

> Generated by Gemini

```json
{
  "review": {
    "summary": "This PR switches the installation source to the `main` branch. While this fixes the broken install for the time being, it introduces significant supply chain and stability risks by not using an immutable reference. It is recommended to pin a Commit SHA instead of a branch name if the tag is not yet available.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 5,
      "title": "Non-deterministic installation source (Security/Stability)",
      "description": "Setting `SOURCE_TAG=\"main\"` means the installer will fetch the latest code from the branch tip every time it runs. This creates a 'moving target' that breaks reproducibility and allows any malicious or unstable commit pushed to `main` to be immediately installed by users without verification.",
      "suggestion": "If the `v2.3.0` tag is not yet ready, use the specific Commit SHA (e.g., `SOURCE_TAG=\"a1b2c3d...\"`) that corresponds to the state of `main` you wish to test. This ensures the installer is deterministic and secure."
