{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR adds well-structured AI skill definitions and a comprehensive integration roadmap. The activation hook logic is sound. However, the 'Deslop' skill's instructions on removing defensive code are overly aggressive for a security-sensitive context, potentially leading to the removal of critical runtime input validation. Additionally, the planned ChatOps feature introduces remote execution risks that should be architected carefully.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"

  "issues": [
    {

      "line": 1,
      "title": "Unsafe 'Remove Defensive Overload' instructions",
      "description": "The instruction to 'Trust the runtime. If it crashes, it crashes' and remove 'defensive overload' is dangerous for Node.js/TypeScript applications. Runtime checks are essential at I/O boundaries (API endpoints, database results, user input) because TypeScript types do not exist at runtime. Removing these checks can lead to application instability (DoS via uncaught exceptions) and security vulnerabilities (missing input validation).",
      "suggestion": "Modify the prompt to explicitly exclude 'Input Validation', 'Public API Boundaries', and 'Security/Auth Checks' from being targeted as 'slop'. The AI should distinguish between redundant internal checks and necessary boundary guards."

      "title": "Security architecture for Gateway ChatOps",
      "description": "The integration plan describes exposing the toolkit via webhooks to accept commands from Slack/Discord. This creates a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector. Without strict authentication, this could be exploited if the tunnel URL leaks.",
      "suggestion": "Add a security section to the plan mandating HMAC signature verification for all incoming webhooks and a strict allowlist of executable commands. Consider requiring a user-confirmation step for destructive actions trigger via chat."
