{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR expands the toolkit's footprint (docs, tools, MCP) and updates the sync frequency to daily. The changes to install.sh correctly handle the new directories and permissions. However, enabling workflow sync by default introduces a supply chain risk that users should be aware of, and the complete removal of CLAUDE.md installation might affect the onboarding experience for fresh installs.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".github/workflows/sync-claude-config.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Default workflow sync increases supply chain risk",
      "description": "Changing `sync_github_workflows` to default to `true` means downstream repositories will automatically ingest workflow changes from the upstream toolkit. While convenient, this grants the upstream repository significant influence over the security and behavior of downstream CI/CD pipelines by default. If the upstream is compromised, changes propagate automatically to the sync PRs of all consumers.",
      "suggestion": "Consider keeping `default: false` or adding a prominent warning/confirmation in the documentation so users explicitly opt-in to automated CI workflow updates."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "severity": "suggestion",
      "file": "install.sh",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Missing initialization for CLAUDE.md",
      "description": "The `install_claude_md` function was removed. While disabling *sync* for this file is a good decision (to preserve local context), removing the *installation* logic means new setups will lack a `CLAUDE.md` entirely. This may leave new users without the expected AI context file.",
      "suggestion": "Add logic to copy a basic template (e.g., from `docs/CLAUDE.md.template`) to `CLAUDE.md` only if the destination file does not exist. This preserves the 'getting started' experience without enforcing ongoing updates."
