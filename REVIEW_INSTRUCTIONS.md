{
  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR robustly implements the two-tier model selection with safe input handling in the shell script. The inclusion of MCP tools is functional, but the use of `npx` without version constraints introduces supply chain risks. The SSRF implications of the 'fetch' tool are significant and properly noted in documentation, but require caution in the workflow configuration.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".github/workflows/claude.yml",
      "line": 0,
      "title": "Unpinned MCP Server Versions",
      "description": "The workflow uses `npx -y` to run `@anthropics/mcp-server-fetch` and `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` without specifying versions. This causes the workflow to always download the latest code, making it vulnerable to supply chain attacks or breaking changes in upstream packages.",
      "suggestion": "Pin the versions in the arguments list to ensure reproducibility and security. Example: `args: [\"-y\", \"@anthropics/mcp-server-fetch@0.1.1\"]`."
    },

      "title": "High SSRF Risk on Self-Hosted Runners",
      "description": "The `fetch` MCP server allows the agent to issue HTTP GET requests to any URL. While appropriate for isolated GitHub-hosted runners doing web research, this configuration is dangerous for self-hosted runners as it allows mapping internal networks or accessing cloud metadata services.",
      "suggestion": "Add a prominent comment in the `claude.yml` workflow file (next to the `fetch` config) warning users to disable this tool or configure network isolation if running on self-hosted infrastructure."
