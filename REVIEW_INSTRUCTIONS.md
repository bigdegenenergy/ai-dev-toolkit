# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

```toml
[review]
summary = "The PR introduces necessary fixes for the Claude Code integration, specifically improving module resolution, switching to a more reliable command-based trigger (`/accept`), and handling git conflicts in the review workflow. However, the PR incorrectly includes a generated artifact (`REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) which must be removed before merging."

title = "Generated artifact committed to repository"
description = "The file `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` appears to be a temporary or generated file containing specific instructions for an agent run. It should not be committed to the source control history of the main branch."

title = "Brittle module resolution"
description = "Constructing paths directly into `node_modules` using `path.join(sdkPath, 'node_modules', ...)` is brittle. It assumes a specific folder structure that might change with different package managers or hoisting behaviors."
suggestion = "Consider using `require.resolve('@anthropic-ai/claude-code', { paths: [sdkPath] })` to robustly locate the package entry point."

title = "Potential data loss with git reset strategy"
description = "Replacing `git pull --rebase` with `git reset --hard` effectively resolves merge conflicts for the instructions file but will wipe out any other uncommitted changes in the workspace. While acceptable for this specific atomic operation, be cautious if this job evolves to generate other artifacts."
suggestion = "No immediate change needed, but ensure this step remains isolated to avoid accidental data loss of other artifacts."
