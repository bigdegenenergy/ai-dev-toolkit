  "review": {
    "summary": "The PR introduces a robust set of AI capabilities including 'Zeno' for surgical analysis and 'Ralph' for autonomous coding, backed by well-structured prompt engineering. The documentation and plans are comprehensive. However, there is a configuration mismatch in the skill triggers where 'autonomous-loop' is defined but lacks a corresponding skill definition, and the 'deslop' skill contains aggressive refactoring instructions that pose risks in loosely-typed or IO-heavy contexts.",
    "decision": "APPROVE"
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "important",
      "file": ".claude/hooks/SkillActivationHook/skill-activation-prompt.mjs",
      "line": 58,
      "title": "Undefined skill 'autonomous-loop' in triggers",
      "description": "The 'autonomous-loop' key is added to `skillTriggers` with high-priority triggers, but there is no corresponding `.claude/skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md` file in the PR (unlike `ralph-coder`, `deslop`, etc.). Documentation suggests 'ralph-coder' is the intended autonomous loop skill. If the runtime maps keys to directory names, this configuration will likely fail or point to a missing resource.",
      "suggestion": "Remove the 'autonomous-loop' entry or merge its triggers into the 'ralph-coder' entry if they are intended to activate the same skill."
    },

      "line": 28,
      "title": "Risky refactoring instruction for Defensive Overload",
      "description": "The prompt instructs the AI to 'Delete if (!data) return patterns in internal functions where types guarantee existence'. In TypeScript projects, runtime data (especially from IO/API) may not match compile-time types. Aggressively removing these checks can introduce runtime crashes if upstream validations are imperfect.",
      "suggestion": "Refine the prompt to include a safety clause: 'Ensure data does not originate from untrusted IO or cast from any/unknown types before removing runtime existence checks.'"

      "line": 48,
      "title": "Generic trigger overlap",
      "description": "The trigger `//(ralph|code|implement|task)/i` allows generic slash commands like `/code` or `/task`. Ensure this does not conflict with existing slash commands or generic usage if the regex is matched loosely.",
      "suggestion": "Verify that `/code` and `/task` are reserved exclusively for the Ralph Coder skill."
