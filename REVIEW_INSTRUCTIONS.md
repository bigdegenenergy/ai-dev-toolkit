# ⚠️ REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS

[review]
summary = "This PR updates the Claude Code implementation logic to support ES Modules and improves git handling. However, the PR includes generated artifacts that should be removed, leftover debug logging in the workflow, and potentially misleading documentation regarding reaction triggers."

title = "Remove generated artifact"
description = "The file `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` appears to be an automated output from the coding agent and explicitly states it should not be merged. Please remove this file."

title = "Remove forced debug logging"
description = "The step 'Debug SDK package structure' uses `|| true` in its `if` condition, forcing verbose debug output (directory listings, file contents) in production runs. This clutters logs and exposes internal paths."
suggestion = "Remove this debug step or strictly condition it on `vars.ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG == 'true'`."

severity = "important"
file = "CLAUDE.md"
line = 36
title = "Clarify reaction trigger limitations"
description = "The documentation suggests users can 'React to the prompt comment' to trigger implementation. However, the workflow triggers are `workflow_dispatch` and `issue_comment`. A simple reaction (emoji) does not generate an `issue_comment` event, so the workflow will not run until a subsequent comment is made. This creates a confusing user experience."
suggestion = "Update the documentation to clarify that an explicit comment (e.g., `/accept`) is the primary trigger, or that reactions only take effect when accompanied by a comment."

title = "Consolidate SDK installation"
description = "The workflow installs the SDK in `/tmp/claude-sdk` and then immediately installs it again in `_trusted_scripts/.github/scripts`. Installing it twice is redundant. It is recommended to install it only once in the location referenced by `SDK_PATH`."
suggestion = "Remove the redundant installation step and ensure `SDK_PATH` points to the single installation location."
